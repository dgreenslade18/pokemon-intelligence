# Browser Automation Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
The application was failing on Vercel with browser automation errors:
```
‚ùå Browser automation failed: Error: Could not find Chrome (ver. 138.0.7204.168)
```

This occurred because Vercel's serverless environment doesn't have Chrome installed by default, but the app was using regular Puppeteer which requires a local Chrome installation.

## Solution
Replaced regular Puppeteer with a Vercel-compatible browser automation setup:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated package.json dependencies:**
   - Removed: `puppeteer: ^24.15.0`
   - Added: `puppeteer-core: ^24.15.0` and `@sparticuz/chromium: ^131.0.0`

2. **Updated browser automation code in `src/app/api/script7/route.ts`:**
   - Now uses `puppeteer-core` with `@sparticuz/chromium`
   - Includes proper serverless configuration
   - Added better error handling and logging

3. **Updated Vercel configuration:**
   - Added `maxDuration: 60` for script7 API route to handle browser automation timing

### How It Works
- `@sparticuz/chromium` provides a pre-compiled Chromium binary optimized for serverless environments
- `puppeteer-core` connects to this binary instead of looking for a system Chrome installation
- The configuration includes proper args and settings for Vercel's constraints

### Fallback Chain
The app now has a robust fallback system:
1. **Regular scraping** (fetch + cheerio) - fastest
2. **Browser automation** (puppeteer-core + @sparticuz/chromium) - for when scraping is blocked
3. **API fallback** (RapidAPI eBay service) - when browser automation fails

### Next Steps
After deployment:
1. Test the browser automation works in production
2. Monitor logs to ensure the new setup resolves the Chrome error
3. Consider adjusting timeouts based on actual performance

### Development Setup
For local development, the code will automatically detect the environment and use the appropriate browser setup.
